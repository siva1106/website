### Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Diabetic Retinopathy and Nephropathy Progression
*Manuscript under review (PubMed-indexed journal: Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications)*
*   Utilized machine learning to predict diabetic retinopathy and kidney disease progression using Hornerin and SFN as novel biomarkers.
*   Analyzed data to validate the efficacy of biomarkers for early disease detection, contributing to improved patient care strategies.

### Virulence Gene Prevalence in Enterococcus faecalis from Dental Infections in South India
*Manuscript under review (Scopus-indexed journal: Indian Journal of Microbiology Research)*
*   Conducted an in-depth study on the prevalence of virulence genes in *E. faecalis* from dental infections.
*   Highlighted the clinical implications of virulence gene distribution, providing key insights into infection mechanisms.

### [Investigating the presence and virulence potential of Enterococcus faecalis](https://srjhs.org/investigating-the-presence-and-virulence-potential-of-enterococcus-faecalis-with-a-focus-on-the-hyaluronidase-factor-in-environmental-samples-insights-from-a-pilot-study/)
*Published in Sri Ramachandra Journal of Health Sciences*
*   Detected a prevalence of hyaluronidase-producing *E. faecalis* in environmental samples, revealing its potential as a virulence factor in non-clinical settings.
*   Advanced the understanding of environmental infection reservoirs to inform public health surveillance.
