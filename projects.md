### Computational and Molecular Profiling of the SNP, rs6493497 of CYP19A1 in Breast Cancer
*(Dec 2025 - April 2025)*
*   Analyzed SNP rs6493497 in CYP19A1, which is linked to increased aromatase in breast cancer.
*   Designed and optimized PCR primers for SNP detection, validating findings using agarose gel electrophoresis.
*   Explored estrogen's role in cancer, proposing the SNP as a potential therapy target.

### Investigation on the incidence of adhesin genes (efaA, efbA, ace) of Enterococcus faecalis from environmental samples in and around Chennai
*(Jan 2023 - May 2023)*
*   Assessed the prevalence of virulence-associated adhesin genes in *Enterococcus faecalis* from environmental sources.
*   Collected samples from diverse locations, isolated DNA, performed PCR amplification, and analyzed gene expression.
*   Detected a high incidence of adhesin genes, indicating a potential public health implication and the need for environmental surveillance.
